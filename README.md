# Linear-Discriminant-Functions-Perceptron-LMS

Repository contains several experiments conducted in the process of exploring the Linear Disdcriminant Functions;Perceptron (Margin + Reloaxation), LMS

A. PerceptronConvergencetheorem.pdf contains proof for perceptron convergence theorem.

B. q2345.py implements the following:

	B1. Single Sample Perceptron Algorithm.

	B2. Single Sample Perceptron with margin.

	B3. Relaxation algorithm with margin.

	B4. Least Mean Squared (LMS) Rule: Pesudo Inverse

	B5. Widrow-Hoff or Least Mean Squared (LMS) Rule: Gradiant Descent

> The data set used for the above two-class problem is
> w1= [(1; 6); (7; 2); (8; 9); (9; 9); (4; 8); (8; 5)]
> w2= [(2; 1); (3; 3); (2; 4); (7; 1); (1; 3); (5; 2)]
